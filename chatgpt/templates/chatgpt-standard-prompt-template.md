# Purpose
- Write a clear, outcome-focused prompt that uses the linked instructions.

# Paste or reference instructions
- Reference: `../../copilot/templates/template.instructions.md`
- If instructions are missing, pause and request them.

# User input checklist
- What you need from the user (files, links, constraints, acceptance criteria).

# System constraints (e.g., length, tone, outputs)
- UK English; concise; cite sources when browsing.
- Respect any length caps (4,000 chars for Space instructions).

# Example first message to Copilot
- “Use `../../copilot/templates/template.instructions.md`. My goal is […]. Inputs are […]. Produce […]. Show your plan then proceed.”

# Verification steps (what “good” looks like)
- Meets acceptance criteria; includes a short changelog; no tool sprawl; runnable outputs.
