## Goal

Create an automated workflow that streamlines the design-to-development handoff process by automatically generating developer-ready assets, documentation, and notifications when Figma designs are updated.

## Inputs

Before setting up this automation, gather the following information:

- **Figma Team/Project**: Figma team URL and specific project files to monitor
- **Development Platform**: GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Slack, etc.
- **Asset Requirements**: Image formats, sizes, naming conventions needed
- **Documentation Format**: Markdown, PDF, HTML, or custom format preferences
- **Team Members**: Developers, designers, and stakeholders to notify
- **Integration Tools**: Slack channels, project management tools, file storage
- **Update Triggers**: What changes should trigger the automation (comments, status changes, etc.)
- **Asset Export Settings**: Specific export parameters (2x, 3x, SVG, PNG, etc.)
- **Naming Conventions**: File and folder naming standards for your team

## Instructions

1. Set up Figma webhook to detect file changes and updates
2. Configure Make.com scenario to process Figma webhook data
3. Extract design specifications and generate developer documentation
4. Export assets automatically based on predefined naming conventions
5. Upload assets to appropriate cloud storage or repository
6. Generate or update design specification documents
7. Create notifications for relevant team members
8. Update project management tools with status changes
9. Archive previous versions and maintain design history
10. Send summary reports of changes to stakeholders

## Quality Checks

The automated workflow should ensure:

- [ ] All required assets are exported in correct formats and sizes
- [ ] Naming conventions are consistently applied across all files
- [ ] Documentation includes accurate measurements, colors, and typography
- [ ] Notifications are sent to appropriate team members only
- [ ] Version control maintains proper file history
- [ ] Asset organization matches development project structure
- [ ] Generated documentation is readable and actionable
- [ ] Integration with existing tools works seamlessly
- [ ] Error handling prevents workflow failures
- [ ] Performance is optimized for large design files

## Safety & Limits

**Do not automate:**
- Deletion of original design files or critical assets
- Publishing to production environments without approval
- Sending notifications to external clients without review
- Overwriting manually created documentation without backup
- Access to sensitive or proprietary design information

**Always include:**
- Backup procedures for all generated assets
- Approval steps for critical changes or publications
- Error handling and rollback procedures
- Access controls and permission management
- Audit logs of all automated actions
- Rate limiting to prevent API overuse

## Examples

### Example Input:
- **Figma Team/Project**: https://figma.com/team/acme-corp/project/mobile-app-redesign
- **Development Platform**: GitHub repository (github.com/acme/mobile-app)
- **Asset Requirements**: PNG @2x and @3x, SVG icons, PDF specs
- **Documentation Format**: Markdown files for GitHub wiki
- **Team Members**: 3 developers, 2 designers, 1 product manager
- **Integration Tools**: Slack #development channel, Jira project board
- **Update Triggers**: Frame status changes to "Ready for Dev"
- **Asset Export Settings**: PNG (@1x, @2x, @3x), SVG (optimized)
- **Naming Conventions**: component-name_state_platform@resolution

### Example Output:

# Make.com Scenario: Figma to Development Handoff

This automation monitors Figma design updates and automatically generates development-ready assets and documentation when designs are marked "Ready for Dev".

## Scenario Components

### 1. Figma Webhook Trigger
- **Webhook URL**: https://hook.integromat.com/[scenario-id]
- **Events**: FILE_VERSION_UPDATE, FILE_COMMENT
- **Filters**: Frame status = "Ready for Dev"

### 2. Asset Processing
- Extract frame coordinates and properties
- Generate asset export URLs for each required format
- Apply naming conventions automatically
- Create folder structure based on component hierarchy

### 3. Documentation Generation
Generate Markdown specifications with:
- Design measurements and properties
- Color values and typography details
- Component states and interactions
- Implementation notes for developers

### 4. Integration Actions
- Upload assets to GitHub repository
- Create pull requests with design updates
- Send Slack notifications to development team
- Update Jira tasks with design specifications

## Implementation Notes

**Setup Time**: 4-6 hours for basic configuration
**Maintenance**: Minimal ongoing maintenance required
**Cost**: Make.com Pro plan ($9/month) + storage costs
**Team Training**: 1-2 hours for designers to learn status workflows
